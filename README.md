## Zod playground.

Just tryna build a playground to run zod schemas without spinning up codesandbox.

## TODO: 
(Would love Pull requests that build towards these objectives)
- [x] CodeMirror intergration
- [] Esbuild compiler intergration or any other way to compiler code without making requests to a server.
- [] Display a form from the zod schema, something like [auto-form](https://github.com/vantezzen/auto-form)
